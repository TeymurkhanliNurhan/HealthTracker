# HealthTracker
This was a group project for our 5th semester "Software Engineer" class.

The Description for this project is here:
# Fitness Tracker Center
# 1.
The center hires doctors, and store their id, staff id, name, birthdates, ages and specialization. There are 3 certain specializations for doctors: Dietitian, sleep specialist and psychologist. There are also coaches (described by id, staff id, name, BD, age) who have 3 different experience types: novice, middle, expert.
# 2.
Users should login to app by entering their ID, userID, name, surname, BD. To start fitness tracking we also need their current weight, height, and goal weight. System also counts the number of users. Every user has a sleep tracker and workout schedules. We need id, date, count of hours and quality (good, bad) for sleep tracker. Workout is organized by 1 coach, and it is determined by id, duration and burned calories for workout. User can reach workout by using unique workoutName code. If coach is unavailable, workout is canceled. Every workout contains one or more exercises. Exercise is described by id, name, and difficulty which is one of easy, medium and hard.
# 3.
Each user has a Fitness Data to track him daily. Each time id, date, steps, distance and burnt calories are stored for this purpose. To control their calories, there are diet and meal. Diet is casual target for a user and determined by id and target calories and it is organized b dietitian. Meal is what the user eats during a day. To store info about meals we need id, list of dishes and calories of them.
# 4.
Different types of devices are used for fitness tracking, mobile devices and wearable devices like smart watch. We need id, and model of them. The devices are also divided into IOS, Android and others. Using mobile and smart watches we can get info about step counts, and distances and using smart watch we also can get about heartrate.
# 5.
Users have HealthMetric which can store info about blood pressure and heart rate (if there are ones) with id. Finally, they can achieve some achivements for their positive improvement, and positive streaks. For an achievement we need id, title and its description. In every achievement succeeded we also need to store its date.
